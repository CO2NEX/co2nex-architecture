Welcome to the **CO2NEX** project — a radically transparent, science-backed carbon credit system integrating **AI**, **satellite data**, **human site visits**, and **verifiable field reports** into one powerful public tool for landowners, certifiers, and climate solution providers.

> 🚀 **Mission:** To make every carbon credit 100% auditable, traceable, and rooted in reality.

## 📌 What This Repo Contains

This repository holds the **core architecture and data model** for building the CO2NEX landowner carbon verification system using **Google Earth Engine**, geospatial overlays, and verified lab + field data. It's designed to be scalable, visual, and honest.

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🗺️ **GEE Integration** | Custom scripts and layers that integrate NDVI, biomass, terrain, and parcel overlays |
| 🧬 **Lab & Field Reports** | Geo-linked photos, soil and water data, biomass readings |
| 🤖 **AI + Satellite Calculations** | Transparent CO2 sequestration estimates using Earth Engine and trained AI models |
| 📈 **Verification Dashboard** | Fully visual proof of site visits, credit issuance, and landowner certification |
| 📦 **Mermaid Flowchart** | Our live workflow map with all components, layers, and execution plan |
| 🔁 **Status Tracker** | Tracks what's complete, what's in development, and what’s next |

## 🔎 Live System Goals

The final GEE-powered map interface (public viewer) will show:

- 🧭 State + biome classification overlays  
- 📍 Verified parcel boundaries  
- 📸 Geo-tagged photos from human field visits  
- 📄 Downloadable lab reports (soil, water, biomass)  
- 🛰️ AI + satellite-calculated CO2 sequestration values  
- 📊 Credit issuance & validation dashboard  
- 🔒 Timestamp + verification type for every data point  
- 🔗 Shareable QR codes and public proof for each landowner

## 🧠 About CO2NEX

We believe the future of the planet must be rooted in **verifiability**, **trust**, and **technology**. CO2NEX builds carbon credits not as "wishful promises" — but as measurable, audited contributions backed by science and satellite data.

Let’s end greenwashing, together. 🌱
