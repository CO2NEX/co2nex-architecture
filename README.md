> **CO2NEX** is building the world’s first **end-to-end blockchain-integrated Article 6-compliant carbon credit infrastructure** — with real-time verification, transparent tokenization, and public accountability.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **Mermaid.js visual blueprint** of the CO2NEX carbon credit lifecycle — from **landowner onboarding** to **Article 6 compliance**, **IPCC-calibrated modeling**, and **ERC-1155 retirement** on-chain.

The entire process is governed by **UNFCCC transparency principles**, **indigenous land rights protections**, and **risk buffers**, monitored through satellite feeds and blockchain data.

---

## 🎯 Mission

To accelerate climate finance, land stewardship, and regenerative infrastructure by making **carbon and water credits fully traceable**, scientifically sound, and blockchain-verifiable.
